# Deep-Neural-networks-for-Recommendations-Research-Project-


The research project focuses on implementing a stacked-autoencoder (SAE) in Recommender Systems for rating prediction. The research aims to explore the hyperparameters optimization techniques and regularization tools to influence SAE's model performance.  The baseline SAE model and the updated SAE models' performances were compared on the MovieLens dataset. RMSE was a proper metric for measuring the performance of the SAE model.  After training and testing the models, the results were analyzed and discussed.
